•	Under create default config init-config-ha will be used for Automate HA - need to add this as well
•	Link to our sample init-config-ha should be added at this stage
•	Airgapped deployment for AWS - that command as well needs to be added. Hence there will some changes and information addition will be required, for which you need to refer to shared air-gapped document and add the necessary information there.
